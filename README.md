ImageOptim-CLI
==============

**A Command Line version of [ImageOptim](http://imageoptim.com/) for the Mac.**

ImageOptim-CLI is a Shell Script which controls ImageOptim.app from the command line.

## Usage

    $ imageOptim /path/to/images

ImageOptim.app will be launched and begin optimising all images in that directory.

## Similar Projects

Similar projects exist such as **[toy/image\_optim](https://github.com/toy/image_optim)** so check that out as well.

The main differences in ImageOptim-CLI are;

1. it does not require you to install each of the optimisation tools yourself.
1. it does not depend on Ruby, it's just Shell.
1. it is new, and is still not yet stable.

Another web optimisation tool is **[JamieMason/Unreadable](https://github.com/JamieMason/Unreadable)**, an intelligent, CSS-aware HTML minifier and optimizer for the command line.

## Please Contribute

I'm a JavaScript Developer who is _fairly_ new to Shell, [forks & contributions](https://github.com/JamieMason/ImageOptim-CLI/pull/new/master) are welcomed.
