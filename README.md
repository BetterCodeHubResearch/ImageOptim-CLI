## Similar Projects

Similar projects exist such as **[toy/image\_optim](https://github.com/toy/image_optim)** so check those out as well. The main difference between these projects are that image_optim has you install each of the optimisation tools yourself but ImageOptim-CLI provides them.

Another web optimisation tool is **[JamieMason/Unreadable](https://github.com/JamieMason/Unreadable)**, a CSS-aware HTML minifier and optimizer for the command line.

## Notes

This project started recently on Feb 15th 2013, so is still pretty alpha.
