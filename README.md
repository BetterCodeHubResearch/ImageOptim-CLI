## Similar Projects

Similar projects exist such as [image_optim](https://github.com/toy/image_optim) by @toy so check those out as well. The main difference between these projects are that image_optim has you install each of the optimisation tools yourself but ImageOptim-CLI provides them.

## Notes

This project started recently on Feb 15th 2013, so is still pretty alpha.
